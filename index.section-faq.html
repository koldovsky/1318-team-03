            Yes, we have 3 vets that specialize in different pets, from cats to
            parrots and exotic animals. Still, we're not a vet clinic, so our
            vets provide only consultations and do not perform any procedures.

            A pet sitter is a person that looks after your pets when you're out.
            It includes feeding, washing, providing walks and exercises, etc.

            Sure, if you need a pet sitter just once, you can order such a
            service. Also, you can request a pet sitter for 1-2 hours and decide
            whether you want to use our services later.
